Guess the Number Game
This Java program is an interactive "Guess the Number" game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. The program provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low and tracks the number of attempts. Users have up to 10 attempts per round to guess the number. Scores are calculated based on the number of attempts taken, with higher points awarded for fewer attempts. The game supports multiple rounds, allowing users to accumulate their scores across rounds. The code also includes user-friendly prompts and proper resource management to ensure a smooth gaming experience.
